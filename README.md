# ai_choose_own_adventure

**This code is from youtube channel Tech with Tim GitHub: Tim Ruscica**

This code is designed to make an API call to OpenAI to create a choose your own adventure game. 

This method eliminates the need to hard code scenarios for the player to choose from as the computer creates them as the player makes choices throughout the game.

**Diclaimer: You need to pay to run the code through OpenAI and generate your own API key and game_token**
